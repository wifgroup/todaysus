## 🔧 WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE ADDED (IMPORTANT)

### 🚨 Must-Have Before Google News Submission

1️⃣ **Real published content**

* At least **10–15 original articles**
* Across **2–3 categories**
* Written, not placeholder

2️⃣ **Author credibility**

* Author bio pages must include:

  * Name
  * Role
  * Short bio
  * Editorial affiliation
* Avoid anonymous publishing

3️⃣ **Corrections transparency**

* Corrections page must be live
* Article updates must be visible (`Updated:`)

4️⃣ **Sitemap**

* Standard sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`)
* Google News sitemap (`/news-sitemap.xml`)

---

## 🧭 NEXT STEPS (CLEAR ORDER)

### 🔹 Step 1 — Content (MOST IMPORTANT)

Before anything else:

* Publish:

  * 3–5 analysis articles
  * 3–5 explainers
  * 3–5 straight news pieces
* No AI-only content
* No rewritten sources

**Rule:** Quality > quantity

---

### 🔹 Step 2 — Category Pages (Finalize)

Each category should:

* Have a short intro paragraph
* List articles chronologically
* No infinite scroll initially

---

### 🔹 Step 3 — Google News Sitemap

Create:

* `/news-sitemap.xml`
* Only articles from last 48 hours
* Proper `<news:news>` tags

---

### 🔹 Step 4 — Google Publisher Center

Submit when:

* Content is live
* Policies are public
* Sitemap is valid

Where:

* [https://publishercenter.google.com/](https://publishercenter.google.com/)

---

### 🔹 Step 5 — Soft Launch

* Remove “Launching soon”
* Enable indexing everywhere
* Submit sitemap in Search Console
* Monitor crawl errors

---

## 🧠 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS (OPTIONAL, PHASE 4)

Do **later**, not now:

* “Most Read” logic via analytics
* Article reading time
* Breaking badge system

---

## ⚠️ WHAT NOT TO DO (VERY IMPORTANT)

* ❌ Don’t rush Google News submission

You have:

* A credible homepage
* Real editorial structure
* Trust & transparency pages
* Clean UI
